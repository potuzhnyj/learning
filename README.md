<h1><b>What I'm Learning & Building</b></h1>
This repo is where I share what I’m learning and creating through the different courses and workshops I’m taking. It’s a space to track my progress, experiment with new skills, and build projects as I go.

Each folder or project comes from a course I’m working on, showing how I’m putting what I learn into practice.
